- 👋 Hi, I’m @nao-e-oEdu
- 👀 I’m interested in learning as much programming languages as possible, become a Linux expert and achieving my first job.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning some languages, such as Java, PHP, SQL, HTML, CSS, C++ and Kotlin through my tech course, also Shell Script and Python by myself.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any great opportunity that shows up to me, whether they are freelancer, stage or apprentice.
- 📫 How to reach me: It can be through my personal e-mail, eduardomina2008@gmail.com or my phone number, +55 (11) 98513-7128.
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I don't look like a nerd, I like skating and stuff... but I absolutely love to code! (and english isn't my main language)
